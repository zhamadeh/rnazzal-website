  <h1>Works</h1>
  <p class="lead">A selection of ongoing and completed bodies of work documenting life, movement, and resistance in Palestine.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Vibrations from Gaza (2024)</h2>
    <p>A short documentary that centers Deaf children in Gaza who perceive bombardment through vibration rather than sound. The work foregrounds touch, tremor, and the constant presence of drones to rethink how violence is sensed and experienced by those who navigate the world differently.</p>
    
    <p>By focusing on the tactile and vibrational dimensions of warfare, the film challenges conventional understandings of how conflict is witnessed and endured, offering insight into the multisensory realities of life under siege.</p>

    <h2>Driving in Palestine (2010–2020; book 2023)</h2>
    <p>A decade-long photographic study produced from inside moving vehicles across the West Bank. The series records checkpoints, watchtowers, walls, signage, and small gestures of daily life, assembling a road atlas of constraint and endurance.</p>
    
    <p>Captured in black and white, these images trace the visible infrastructure of occupation—the architecture of surveillance and control that shapes Palestinian mobility. Hand-drawn maps and critical essays in English and Arabic accompany the photographs, creating a comprehensive document of movement under military rule.</p>
    
    <p>Published by Fernwood Publishing in 2023, <em>Driving in Palestine</em> offers a sustained meditation on how geography itself becomes a tool of dispossession, and how Palestinians navigate a landscape designed to restrict their freedom.</p>

    <h2>We, the Wild Plants and Fruit Trees (2022– )</h2>
    <p>An ongoing series of photographs and notes tracing the lives of wild flora and cultivated trees within militarized ecologies. This work examines how plants bear witness to land use, enclosure, displacement, and care.</p>
    
    <p>Through images of fig trees, olive groves, wild herbs, and resilient vegetation growing through ruins, the project explores botany as a form of memory and resistance. These plants persist despite attempts to erase Palestinian presence from the land, becoming living archives of cultural and ecological knowledge.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Invisible (2014)</h2>
    <p>A video and photographic installation engaging with incarceration and political prisoners. The work includes four video pieces and 1,700 photographs forming a field of fragments and testimony.</p>
    
    <p>One video, <em>Bil'in</em>, documents the artist's experience in the village of Bil'in where Palestinians and international solidarity activists were physically attacked by Israeli forces during weekly protests against land confiscation. The sound remains intact while the image is reconstructed to represent the feeling of being suffocated and blinded by tear gas.</p>
    
    <p>Another video, <em>Target</em>, consists of over 127 rapidly flashing images of Palestinians who were extrajudicially assassinated across the world or in occupied Palestine—including the artist's own brother, killed in Athens in 1986 at age 38. The quick editing formally represents how these lives were cut short.</p>
    
    <p>Exhibited at Karsh-Masson Gallery in Ottawa City Hall, the installation was publicly condemned by Israel's ambassador to Canada, sparking important conversations about censorship, representation, and the politics of Palestinian art in Canada.</p>
