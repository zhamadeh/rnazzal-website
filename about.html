  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <div class="section">
    <p class="lead">Rehab Nazzal is a Palestinian-born multidisciplinary artist whose work examines mobility, vibration, incarceration, and ecologies of care in Palestine.</p>
    
    <p>Working across photography, video, sound, and installation, she explores how structures of control shape sensing and everyday movement. Born in Jenin in the occupied West Bank, Nazzal is currently based between Montréal and Bethlehem.</p>
    
    <p>Her practice centers on the effects of settler-colonial violence on the bodies and minds of colonized peoples, on the land, and on other non-human life. Through documentary approaches and immersive installations, she creates spaces for witnessing and understanding Palestinian experience.</p>
    
    <p>Nazzal's work has been exhibited internationally at institutions including the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Karsh-Masson Gallery, Gallery 101, and numerous film festivals and art venues. In 2014, her exhibition <em>Invisible</em> at Ottawa City Hall sparked significant public discourse when it was condemned by Israel's ambassador to Canada.</p>
    
    <p>In December 2015, while photographing a military raid in occupied Palestine, Nazzal was shot in the leg by an Israeli sniper—a stark reminder of the risks faced by those documenting occupation.</p>
