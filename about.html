    <div>
      <p class="lead">Rehab Nazzal is a Palestinian-born multidisciplinary artist whose work examines mobility, vibration, incarceration, and ecologies of care in Palestine.</p>
      <p>Working across photography, video, sound, and installation, she explores how structures of control shape sensing and everyday movement. Based between Montréal and Bethlehem, Nazzal's practice centres the effects of settler‑colonial violence on people, land, and non‑human life.</p>
      <p>Her work has been exhibited internationally and has sparked public conversations about censorship and representation, including following her 2014 installation <em>Invisible</em> at Ottawa City Hall.</p>
      <p class="small">Teaching: Dar Al‑Kalima University (Bethlehem), Simon Fraser University, Western University, Ottawa School of Art. Currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Concordia University.</p>
      <p class="small">Awards: SSHRC Doctoral Award; Documentary Photography for Social Justice Award (Toronto Metropolitan University); Edmund & Isobel Ryan Visual Arts Award (University of Ottawa); Ontario Graduate Scholarship.</p>
